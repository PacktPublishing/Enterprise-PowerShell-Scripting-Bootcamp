# Enterprise PowerShell Scripting Bootcamp
This is the code repository for [Enterprise PowerShell Scripting Bootcamp](https://www.packtpub.com/virtualization-and-cloud/enterprise-powershell-scripting-bootcamp?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787288287), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Enterprise PowerShell Scripting Bootcamp explains how to create your own repeatable PowerShell scripting framework. This framework contains script logging methodologies, answer file interactions, and string encryption and decryption strategies.

This book focuses on evaluating individual components to identify the systemâ€™s function, role, and unique characteristics. To do this, you will leverage built-in CMDlets and Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to explore Windows services, Windows processes, Windows features, scheduled tasks, and disk statistics. You will also create custom functions to perform a deep search for specific strings in files and evaluate installed software through executable properties
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

Chapter 1 does not contain any code.

The code will look like the following:
```
$sid = "S-1-5-18"
$usersid = New-Object System.Security.Principal.
SecurityIdentifier("$SID")
$usersid.Translate( [System.Security.Principal.NTAccount]).Value
```

To work through the examples provided in Enterprise PowerShell Scripting Bootcamp,
you will need access to two Server 2012 R2, or greater, Windows Server operating
systems. Preferably, both systems will be joined to a domain. The chapters in this book
highly rely on Windows Management Framework and it is recommended to leverage
version 5.0 for PowerShell 5.0. You will need to download and install Windows
Management Framework on the systems you are running these examples on.
